    "## Description\n",
    "This notebook provides a tool to calculate ground truth (GT) for ATR (automated text recognition) projects by providing the number of characters, words and lines, resüectively. The instructions below offer some neccessary preparatory steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparations\n",
    "For this notebook to fulfull its task please prepare a folder containing two subfolders titled `src`and `data`. Save the notebook in the `src` folder. Save your GT as a `txt` file named `GT-txt` into the `data`folder. Make sure there are no xml-encodings left as the tool would count these as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Save your results\n",
    "If you wish to save your results, this notebook will save them as `GT-total.csv` in the `data`folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Changes\n",
    "If needed do not hesitate to change the code to fit your project."
